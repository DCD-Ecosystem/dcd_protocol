Docker image build. 

1. Start from the docker folder
```cd dcd_protocol/docker
```

2. Start the container build (long build)
```./docker_build.sh
```
The build is done in the background, the output console can be closed

The build log can be viewed from the file docker_build.log
The PID to access the build process can be viewed in the file docker_build.pid

To stop the image build run
```./docker_build_stop.sh 
```

3. Run the network with 5 nodes from 5 separate containers with autoconfiguration:
```./run.h
```

Network configuration parameters:
accountnum1o - main validator ( balance 20 000, stakes 16% from total network budget);
accountnum11 - validator (balance 30 800)
accountnum12 - validator (balance 1000)
accountnum13, accountnum14, accountnum15 - user accounts, starting balance 300 tokens;
commission 1 USD;
1 USD = 0.5 DCD.

After the successfull start inside node0 several system state catalogues are created:
node0/dcd_wall - logs generated by automatic configuring, generated keys and producer accounts 
node0/worklog - logs of the main node output

You can verify that the network is functioning with 3 producers, swithching between each outher. 
The password for the wallet is generated and can be looked up in node0/dcd_wall/genessislog.txt

4. Exec into the node container
```docker exec -it node0 bash
```
To execute any requests to the node manually you can use dcdcli:
```
dcdcli --wallet-url http://localhost:8899 --url http://172.19.0.2:8010 get account accountun11
```

5. To stop the containers
```./stop.sh
```

After the cahin restart the blockchain data is preserved, to start from scratch run
```./delete_nodes_data.sh
```
