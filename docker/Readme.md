Docker image build. 

1. Start from the docker folder
```
cd dcd_protocol/docker
```

2. Start the container build (long build)
```
./docker_build.sh
```
The build is done in the background, the output console can be closed

The build log can be viewed from the file docker_build.log
The PID to access the build process can be viewed in the file docker_build.pid

To show the log run
```
./docker_build_show_log.sh
```

To stop the image build run
```
./docker_build_stop.sh 
```

3. Before using the network you will need to register a new account in the testnet
then add the data from the created account into run.sh

4. Run node, verify that the script has read your public account info correctly and the 
config files have been generated. The finalization for the process should be marked with : "Node is working" message

```
./run.sh
```

5. Check the node log running
```
./show_node_log.sh
```
Verify that the blocks from the testnet are  being received

In the node parameters your created account is set as a producer, however until it is voted in as a validator it will
only receive blocks, as soon as you have the validator rights you should see the blocks generated by your node in the log



6. Interacting with the node
Log into the container
```
docker exec -it usernode bash
```
From the container you can interact with the node via dcdcli command
```
dcdcli get info
```

config directory contains node startup configs
blockchain contains the produced and received block data
log directory contains the logs generated by the node

7. To stop the containers
```
./stop.sh
```

After the cahin restart the blockchain data is preserved, to start from scratch run
```
./delete_nodes_data.sh
```
