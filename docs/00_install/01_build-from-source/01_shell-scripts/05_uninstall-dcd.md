content_title: Uninstall DCD
---

If you have previously built DCD from source and now wish to install the prebuilt binaries, or to build from source again, it is recommended to run the `dcd_uninstall.sh` script within the `eos/scripts` folder:

```sh
cd ~/dcd/eos
./scripts/dcd_uninstall.sh
```

[[info | Uninstall Dependencies]]
| The uninstall script will also prompt the user to uninstall DCD dependencies. This is recommended if installing prebuilt DCD binaries or building DCD for the first time.
