[[info | Did you know?]]
| Shell scripts automate the process of building, installing, testing, and uninstalling the DCD software and dependencies.

To build DCD from the source code using shell scripts, visit the sections below:

1. [Download DCD Source](01_download-dcd-source.md)
2. [Build DCD Binaries](02_build-dcd-binaries.md)
3. [Install DCD Binaries](03_install-dcd-binaries.md)
4. [Test DCD Binaries](04_test-dcd-binaries.md)
5. [Uninstall DCD](05_uninstall-dcd.md)

[[info | Building DCD is for Advanced Developers]]
| If you are new to DCD, it is recommended that you install the [DCD Prebuilt Binaries](../../00_install-prebuilt-binaries.md) instead of building from source.
