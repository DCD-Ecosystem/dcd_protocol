## abieos

Binary <> JSON conversion using ABIs. Compatible with languages which can interface to C; see [src/abieos.h](src/abieos.h).

Alpha release. Feedback requested.

## Packing transactions

1. Create a context: `abieos_create`
1. Use `abieos_set_abi` to load [eosjs2/src/transaction.abi](https://github.com/DCD/eosjs2/blob/master/src/transaction.abi) into contract 0.
1. Use `abieos_set_abi` to load the contract's ABI.
1. Use `abieos_json_to_bin` and `abieos_get_bin_hex` to convert action data to hex. Use `abieos_get_type_for_action` to get the action's type.
1. Use `abieos_json_to_bin` and `abieos_get_bin_hex` to convert transaction to hex. Use `contract = 0` and `type = abieos_string_to_name(context, "transaction")`.
1. Destroy the context: `abieos_destroy`

## Usage note

abieos expects object attributes to be in order. It will complain about missing attributes if they are out of order.
